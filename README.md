## Problem Statement:

There are many people who travel to and from their daily workplace to their nearest public transportation station. This web app aims to provide a medium for such people to group up and share the auto rickshaw/cab prices. Using the app, the passengers can share their location and the how many people they represent. Accordingly, it would list all people in the same location with whom you can pair up depending on the maximum capacity of the vehicle. 

Say for instance "Abc" is with his friend "Def" looking for a ride sharer for an auto rickshaw. He would be suggested a single person "Ghi" since the maximum cappacity of an auto rickshaw is 3. Similarly, "Ghi" would be suggested "Abc" as a group of 2 people for ride sharing. 

It is an simple attempt to aide ride sharing!
